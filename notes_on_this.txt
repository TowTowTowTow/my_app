1)  Make a directory and navigate into it.

2)  Create the repository. (Turn the directory into a repository.)
        git init
            This initializes the Git repository.

3)  Make files in the ***directory/repositrory***
        echo 'this is a readme file'>README
        echo "'''this is a python file''' print('hallow world')">new.py
        touch databasemammmajamma.db
            These create a README file, python file, and a database file. The creation 
            of these specific files and their types are not relevant to the Git process
            as long as we're making files that are to be commited. 

4)  This could be done at any point, but to see what's going on we'll look at the
   status.
        git status
            The status tells us which files aren't being tracked, have been modified,
            deleted, ect.

5)  "Stage" your changes.
        git add README
        git add new.py
        git add databasemammmajamma.db
        git add .
            "git add whatever.file" is telling git to include whatever.file into the next 
            commit. We can pass in any specific file this way or use "git add ." to catch
            everything.

6)  Commit the changes.
        git commit -m'This be my first commit evarr"
            Anything that was "staged", or added, gets committed to your repository. A
            "commit" is a short snapshot of your code. Almost like you make a zip file 
            and store it somewhere (except way more efficent.) It will always be there;
            you can refer to it whenever you want. 

7)  Repeat steps 5-6 at will.
        git add .
        git commit -m'whatever message you want'
            Create more files. Add the files. (Optiponal check status). Commit the added
            files.

8)  You can also skip the "add" step provided that you only have modified files and
    haven't created any new ones.
        git commit -a -m'whatever message you want'


9)  Revert some changes.
        git checkout README
            Back in your text editor the file should be back to how it was the last time
            you made a commit. 



@ These four simple commands:
    *** init, add, commit, and checkout ***
    will enable you to create a history of your code and remove all sorts of risk in your 
    development workflow.
@ also git log shows you your commit history for the current branch
@ also git checkout -b new_branch_name makes a new branch

??? Questions ???
1) Can I see the versions of commits that I made by the message name?
            - Yes. Also refer to them as "commits" to avoid confusion.
2) Where do I see these verious commits that I made by the message name?
            - git log - In the command line of the directory of the repository
3) Why do I make the commit messages if not for reference?
            - Yes for reference
4) Is the difference between a directory and a repository that a repository is a specific
    kind of directory that had the .git files added to it? Are they synonymous terms when
    applied in the git context?
            - Yes. Kind of, but no. 
5) Can you and how can you rollback to a prior commit on any given branch?




Remote Repositories (on github)

1)  Log in and create a new repository on github. Name it whatever.
2)  Add the remote repository to your local "working tree". Navigate to the directory 
    of your local repository.
        git remote add origin git@github.com:your_name/direct_reposit_name.git
            This adds a "remote". The syntax is git
