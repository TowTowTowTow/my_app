1) Make a directory and navigate into it.

2) Create the repository. (Turn the directory into a repository.)
        git init
            This initializes the Git repository.

3) Make files in the ***directory/repositrory***
        echo 'this is a readme file'>README
        echo "'''this is a python file''' print('hallow world')">new.py
        touch databasemammmajamma.db
            These create a README file, python file, and a database file. The creation 
            of these specific files and their types are not relevant to the Git process
            as long as we're making files that are to be commited. 

4) This could be done at any point, but to see what's going on we'll look at the
   status.
        git status
            The status tells us which files aren't being tracked, have been modified,
            deleted, ect.

5) "Stage" your changes.
        git add README
        git add new.py
        git add databasemammmajamma.db
        git add .
            "git add whatever.file" is telling git to include whatever.file into the next 
            commit. We can pass in any specific file this way or use "git add ." to catch
            everything.
